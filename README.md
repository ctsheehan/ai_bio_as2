Assignment 2: Ai in Biology

Part of class time on Friday, February 12 will be (or was, depending on when you read this) devoted to further exploring the fuel efficiency dataset and trying to build a better model for predicting a vehicle's fuel efficiency.

For this assignment, submit Python code to create, fit, and evaluate your final, best model for predicting fuel efficiency.  You can either paste your code directly into Canvas or supply a link to a notebook file stored in a repository on Github, if you prefer.

The code you submit should include everything needed for a complete, working Python script, including, at a minimum, these pieces:
- load the data
- select (and create, if needed) the predictor variables for the model
- create and fit the linear model
- print model evaluation information, which must include, at a minimum, R2
